You will first want to run the "Himmy.py" also known as the web server first
Once that file is running as intented, you will want to run the "Himmyrat.py" on the victims system 

You can use any cmd prompt actions, for example running netstat. It will execute on the system as intended. 

How to turn the rat file into an exe. (By no means will this go undetected on a system, making it an exe file lowers the chances)
You will need to install PyInstaller onto your system (pip install PyInstaller)
(Ensure you are in the right directory of the files)
Then you will execute (PyInstaller (filename) --noconsole --onefile)
Rename the file to something a "enduser" would likely click. For example "PTO requests"
Run the executable and it will start listening back to the web server.
